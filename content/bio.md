Hi there 👋,

I'm a third-year Ph.D. student at Paul Sabatier University, doing my research for Renault's Applied Artificial Intelligence team.

I work on NLP and Knowledge Graph. In addition, I study Mutual Learning and Knowledge Distillation.

Some of the applications of my PhD are:

- Information Retrieval 📑
- Classification 🔍
- Recommendation ⭐️
- Knowledge-intensive tasks 📚

I'm a Python developer interested in:

- Software Engineering 🐍
- Machine Learning 🤖
- Statistics 📈
- Data Viz 📊
- Databases 💾
- Cloud 🐳

I contribute to some open-source libraries and often participate in machine learning competitions. I will use this blog to share my journey.
